# U-Net Implementation

## Intro:

This is a vanilla U-Net implementation (from the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597)) with an emphasis on readability and ease of use. The code uses the Carvana dataset, but can be made to work with any other dataset trivially.

## Installation:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Next steps:

- [ ] - `hydra` integration
- [ ] - `wandb` integration
