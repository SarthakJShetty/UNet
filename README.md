# Vanilla U-Net Implementation

## Intro:

This is a vanilla U-Net implementation. I want to go back to my deep learning roots, and start working on implementing a few simple architectures. I'd like to tinker with training guardrails here as well, such as config systems, logging, `.toml` etc.

## Checklist:

- [ ] -  `model.py` file
- [ ] - `hydra` config system
- [ ] - `wandb` logging system
- [ ] - `poetry`/`pyproject.toml` file
